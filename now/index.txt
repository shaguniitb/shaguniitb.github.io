As of September 6, 2020, I'm spending all my time on these things:

* Settling in to my new home in Seattle!
* Checking out the hiking spots close to my place over the weekends.
* Collaborating with some amazing folks at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), [Max Planck Institute](https://www.mpi-sws.org), [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), [UW](http://www.washington.edu), and [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) on a bunch of exciting projects.
* Going through a ton of orientations at UW and Berkman Klein Center.
* Trying out [Zen To Done (ZTD)](https://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/) as my new Productivity System.
* Reading [War and Peace] by Leo Tolstoy.
