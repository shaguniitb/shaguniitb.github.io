As of May 15, 2021, I'm spending my time on these things:

* Working from the beautiful UW campus for the first time since I moved to Seattle back in August.
* Checking out the hiking spots close to my place in Seattle over the weekends.
* Building a system to address the content moderation needs of YouTube creators.
* Collaborating with some amazing folks at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), [Max Planck Institute](https://www.mpi-sws.org), [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv) on really exciting projects.
* Preparing to move to New Brunswick, NJ to start my new job at Rutgers SCI.
* Reading [Pigs have Wings](https://www.amazon.com/Pigs-Have-Wings-P-Wodehouse/dp/1585670596) by P. G. Wodehouse.
