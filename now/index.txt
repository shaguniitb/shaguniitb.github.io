As of October 23, 2019, I'm spending all my time on these things:

* Leading recitation and serving as the head TA for the new course ["Computing, Society, & Professionalism"](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~asb/teaching/4863/fall2019/index.html) at Georgia Tech.
* Preparing materials for the academic job market.
* Mentoring undergraduate and graduate students at Georgia Tech on 3 very exciting projects.
* Writing my dissertation "Identifying Opportunities to Improve Content Moderation."
* (Still) Recovering from a pulled back muscle.
* Reading [No Country for Old Men](https://www.cormacmccarthy.com/works/no-country-for-old-men/) by Corman McCarthy.
