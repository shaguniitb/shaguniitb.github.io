I am a Postdoctoral scholar in the [Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu) and an Affiliate at the [Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society](https://cyber.harvard.edu) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu). Prior to this, I received a PhD in Computer Science from the [School of Interactive Computing](https://ic.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu). 

My research is broadly in the area of social computing and human-computer interaction. I study how moderation systems on digital platforms work, and how they affect platform owners, content moderators, and end-users. My most recent projects evaluate the effects of banning or quarantining Reddit communities, examine the potential of a restorative justice approach to addressing online harassment in gaming communities, and analyze the moderation mechanisms that curate Facebook ads.

My dissertation research informs the design of efficient and equitable content moderation systems. In earlier stages of my dissertation work, I studied online harassment, blocking mechanisms, and human-machine mixed-initiative content moderation on Twitter and Reddit. My recent work evaluates the effectiveness of community-wide moderation interventions and examines platform decisions in the framework of Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics (FATE) model.
