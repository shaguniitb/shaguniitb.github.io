## Hello there!

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Library and Information Science ([LIS](https://comminfo.rutgers.edu/about/library-and-information-science-department)) in the School of Communication and Information ([SC&I](https://comminfo.rutgers.edu)) at Rutgers University. Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu) and an Affiliate at the [Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society](https://cyber.harvard.edu) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu). I received a PhD in Computer Science from the [School of Interactive Computing](https://ic.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu). 

My work lies at the intersection of Social Computing, Human-Computer Interaction and Data Science. I study the governance mechanisms of internet platforms to understand how their design, technical affordances, and policies affect public discourse. I use a mixed methods approach, combining system building, casual inference of community data, surveys, and interviews to explore how platforms can address societal issues such as online harassment and the rise of hate groups. 

<!---

I attend to the perspectives of different groups of end-users and administrators to develop a holistic understanding of platform governance and design solutions that make the internet safer and fairer.


My dissertation research informs the design of efficient and equitable content moderation systems. In earlier stages of my dissertation work, I studied online harassment, blocking mechanisms, and human-machine mixed-initiative content moderation on Twitter and Reddit. My recent work evaluates the effectiveness of community-wide moderation interventions and examines platform decisions in the framework of Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics (FATE) model. 

## I am on the academic job market!
