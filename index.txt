I am a PhD candidate studying Computer Science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) in the [School of Interactive Computing](https://ic.gatech.edu). My advisors are [Dr. Amy Bruckman](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Amy.Bruckman/) and [Dr. Eric Gilbert](http://eegilbert.org).  

I use both qualitative and quantitative methods to study content moderation, human-machine collaboration, sharing economies and the future of work. My dissertation research informs the design of efficient and equitable content moderation systems. Previously, I have studied online harassment, blocking mechanisms, and human-machine mixed-initiative content moderation on Twitter and Reddit. My recent work evaluates platform decisions in the framework of Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics (FATE) model.
