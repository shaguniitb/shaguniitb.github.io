I am a Postdoctoral scholar in the [Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu) and an Affiliate at the [Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society](https://cyber.harvard.edu) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu). Prior to this, I received a PhD in Computer Science from the [School of Interactive Computing](https://ic.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu). 

My research is broadly in the area of social computing and human-computer interaction. I study the governance mechanisms of internet platforms to understand how their design, technical affordances, and written policies affect public discourse.
I use a mixed methods approach, combining large-scale casual inference of community data, surveys, and deep qualitative interviews to explore how platforms can address societal issues such as online harassment and the rise of hate groups. My most recent projects evaluate the effects of banning and quarantining Reddit communities, examine the potential of a restorative justice approach to address online harassment in gaming communities, and build end-user moderation tools for YouTube creators.

My dissertation research informs the design of efficient and equitable content moderation systems. In earlier stages of my dissertation work, I studied online harassment, blocking mechanisms, and human-machine mixed-initiative content moderation on Twitter and Reddit. My recent work evaluates the effectiveness of community-wide moderation interventions and examines platform decisions in the framework of Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics (FATE) model.
