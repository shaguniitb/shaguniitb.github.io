## Abstract

 Online harassment is a growing and significant social problem. Most of the efforts to address online harassment have focused on creating moderation tools. A persistent complaint with current moderation mechanisms is that they often can’t distinguish passionate disagreements from online harassment. In this position paper, I argue that researchers and designers should focus on creating tools that can make these nuanced distinctions. I also call for designing different solutions for addressing online harassment and sincere misunderstandings. I propose that tools that influence individuals to find common ground despite having different views can be used to help manage the problem of online abuse.
