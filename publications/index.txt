Description: Shagun Jhaver studies content moderation on social media websites.
---

My research builds a foundation for **designing fair and efficient content moderation** systems. I have contributed in-depth descriptions of how moderation systems on Twitter, Reddit and YouTube are constituted and how they affect platform owners, content moderators, and end-users. My recent projects emphasize the following themes:

- Building systems to counteract hate speech and empower content creators
- Characterizing the landscape of multi-level governance structures in online social platforms, drawing from taxonomies of offline institutions, including administrative hierarchy, federalism and polycentricity
- Developing evidence-backed solutions for platforms to incorporate fairness and transparency in their communications with end-users
- Contributing new computational frameworks to evaluate the effectiveness of moderation strategies on social media sites
- Deriving empirical insights on the use of blocking tools and restorative justice practices to address online harassment
