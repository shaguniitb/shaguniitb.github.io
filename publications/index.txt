My dissertation research builds a foundation for **designing fair and efficient content moderation** systems. I have contributed an in-depth description of how moderation systems on Twitter and Reddit are constituted and how they affect platform owners, content moderators, and end-users. I have also evaluated the effectiveness of different moderation strategies on the health of these platforms. By attending to the viewpoints and practices of different stakeholders, my research offers a holistic view of content moderation, allowing me to identify opportunities for improvements that are both meaningful for the end-users as well as feasible for the community managers to implement.
